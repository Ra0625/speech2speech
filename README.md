# Speech-to-Speech - Generate high quality synthetic speech
This is a consulting project for Respeecher done as part of Insight Artificial Intelligence Fellowship. 

## Background 
Voice conversion is a widely useful technology which can boost creative possibilities, multiply employment opportunities and benefit people with speech impediments.  Creating high quality speech content is a new and  challenging technology chiefly because of lack of affordable, production quality voice data for developing new speech conversion algorithms. I have developed a speech synthesis pipeline which learns high-level speech descriptors  and extracts speaker representation allowing speaker conversion. This framework aims to obtains significantly high similarity and naturalness to human voice.

## Data 
For training the generating model I have used the VCTK dataset, which has speech recordings of 109 different speakers. 
[VCTK dataset](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html). The dataset consists of speech data uttered by 109 speakers of English in varius accents. ach speaker reads out about 400 sentences, most of which were selected from a newspaper plus the Rainbow Passage and an elicitation paragraph intended to identify the speaker's accent. The newspaper texts were taken from The Herald (Glasgow), with permission from Herald & Times Group. Each speaker reads a different set of the newspaper sentences, where each set was selected using a greedy algorithm designed to maximise the contextual and phonetic coverage. The Rainbow Passage and elicitation paragraph are the same for all speakers.
